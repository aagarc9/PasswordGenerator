# PasswordGenerator

In this week's homework, the user will be able to generate a password based on the prompt criteria (numbers, symbols, Upper and Lower case letters). This will show my skills in creating new code in the existing Java code that was provided. This will show my skills in understanding how to use functions, if statements, and for loops to generate a random password. 

## Acceptance Criteria 
* GIVEN I need a new, secure password
* WHEN I click the button to generate a password
* THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* WHEN prompted for password criteria
* THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password
* THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
* THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special  characters
* WHEN I answer each prompt
* THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered
* THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated
* THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
